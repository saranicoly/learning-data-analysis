- before you can use regular expressions in your program, you must import
the library using "import re"
- you can use re.search() to see if a string matches a regular expression,
similar to using the find() method for strings
- you can use re.findall() to extract portions of a string that match your
regular expression, similar to a combination of find() and slicing: var[5:10]
- re.search() returns a true/false depending on wheter the string matches the
regular expression
- if we actually want the matching strings to be extracted, we use re.findall()
example:

import re
x = "My favorite numbers are 19 and 42"
y = re.findall("[0-9]+", x)
print(y)
>>>["2", "19", "42"]

- the repeat characters (* and +) push outward in both directions (greedy) to
match the largest possible string
example:
import re
x = "From: Using the : character"
y = re.findall("^F.+:", x)
print(y)
>>>["From: Using the :"]

- for a non-greedy matching you can add an ? after .+     >>>> ^F.+?:
- you can refine the match for re.findall() and separately determine which
portion of the match is to be extracted by using parentheses
example:
From emailaddress@mail.com anything 27 other
y = re.findall("\S+@\S+", x)
print(y)
>>> emailaddress@mail.com

- "@([^ ]*)"
